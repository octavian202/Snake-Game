# Snake-Game
This is a simple snake game made with the help from a course on Scrimba. I tried to make this game in my own way, but it didn't really work as I expected it to. Now I've build this again without watching the tutorial. I think it's a cool thing to build, especially when you're a beginner. The proccess wasn't very hard, but I had to get a little help to make it. 

I want to add some styling to so it looks better and I make it in my own way, which should come out pretty.
